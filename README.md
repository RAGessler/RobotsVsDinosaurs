Right now the set robot & dinosaur are hard coded into the battlefield class.  this will change when i work on bonus problem two
I did not make the weapon selector for the fleet functional as that was not specified.
In order to run game with single dinosaur vs single robot, change the classes on line 7 and 8 of battlefield.py to the respective classes.
